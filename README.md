<h1>IT Strategic Assessment Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the IT infrastructure of our small Eritrean Orthodox church, founded in 2017 to serve Orthodox believers in Louisville, KY. The church operates on a minimal IT budget and relies on basic digital tools to support its religious services, administrative tasks, and community outreach.
Currently, the church utilizes a few laptops, a projector, and essential software such as Microsoft 365. While these resources help maintain core operations, there are several areas for improvement, including better organization of digital records, enhanced communication channels, and minor security improvements.
This report identifies key IT challenges and proposes cost-effective solutions that align with the church’s financial limitations. With an annual IT budget of approximately $500, the focus is on maximizing existing resources and implementing strategic improvements that will increase efficiency without requiring significant financial investment.
